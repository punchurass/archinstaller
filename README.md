# archinstaller
Simple script to instal Arch Linux with a GUI

*I strongly reccomend editing the scripts BEFORE running them*

To use this script, copy the contents of the repository to a usb drive
insert the drive into the computer that you need to install arch linux on
create the directory /INSTALL
mount the drive to /INSTALL
run 'bash /INSTALL/install_begin.sh'
