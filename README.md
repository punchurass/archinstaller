# archinstaller
Simple script to instal Arch Linux with a GUI

*I strongly reccomend editing the scripts BEFORE running them*

<br>To use this script, copy the contents of the repository to a usb drive</br>
<br>insert the drive into the computer that you need to install arch linux on</br>
<br>create the directory /INSTALL</br>
<br>mount the drive to /INSTALL</br>
<br>run 'bash /INSTALL/install_begin.sh'</br>
